     8: We're gonna talk about classes, instance variables and some other stuff right now. Classes in Ruby provide a way to establish a hierarchy of objects. A car class could be the parent of a Honda Accord class and that same car class could be the child class of a vehicle class. Within any class you can make objects which are instances of the class. The object you create could possess qualities like name or amount, etc. Inside of your class you could have methods that perform actions on those variables of the object. All of that is pretty abstract and theoretical, but the point of classes is that they can actually mirror simple real world objects pretty easily. To help you understand, I created the following example.

     8:   We're gonna talk about classes, instance variables and some other stuff right now. Classes in Ruby provide a way to establish a hierarchy of objects. A car class could be the parent of a Honda Accord class and that same car class could be the child class of a vehicle class. Within any class you can make objects which are instances of the class. The object you create could possess qualities like name or amount, etc. Inside of your class you could have methods that perform actions on those variables of the object. All of that is pretty abstract and theoretical, but the point of classes is that they can actually mirror simple real world objects pretty easily. To help you understand, I created the following example.

    13:   This example shows a simple way to run a loop in Ruby. There is an array of elements on line one, on line 2 I call .each to iterate over the array, followed by keyword do to signal the content of my iteration, then inbetween pipes is the parameter which you can name basically anything you want. On line 3 I just tell the program to print the element to the screen and then I end the loop on line 4. The .each method runs this code with each element in the array, so the end result is that it prints each element to the screen.
    14: 
    15:   Javascript loops tend to be a bit more complicated because you have to write out some of the hidden parts that make the .each method work in Ruby. But the complication is not arbitrary, in fact it makes total sense, and part of me actually likes it better than just whipping out a fancy Ruby method.

So this measurement is always made in terms of what the input is and looking at the size of the input. There are a few different ways this can work out, so here are a few examples. Below is a method that runs in constant time, meaning no matter what the size of the input, the method will always take the same amount of time.

    10:   Big O notation refers to calculating how long an algorithm takes to run relative to the input as the size of the input increases. So this measurement is always made in terms of what the input is and looking at the size of the input. There are a few different ways this can work out, so here are a few examples. Below is a method that runs in constant time, meaning no matter what the size of the input, the method will always take the same amount of time.
