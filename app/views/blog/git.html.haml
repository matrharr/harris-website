  Git and Version Control
%h5
  Version control is a crucial component to writing code, and one way to do it is through using git and the website GitHub. Version control is basically the idea that as software(or any project actually) is developing, you will want to try out experimental ideas with your code that may or may not be something you want in the final product. In order to do this, you create "branches" off of the master code that allow to explore different possibilities. If the new feature doesn't break everything and turns out to be something good, then you can merge it back to the master code. Having the ability to move around like that is already great, but another huge component of Version Control is the organization of the edits. Being able to look back and see all the commits and even restore the master branch to a previous state are huge tools in effectively writing code.

  Git is a great version control system because it allows you to do all of these things pretty easily with relatively straightforward syntax. Simple arguments like "git status," "git add," and "git commit" give the user a lot of power and make it a easy tool to get things done.
  GitHub is a popular website that remotely holds software repositories. You can work on files with git locally, making changes that you want to certain branches, then upload your changes to the site. GitHub allows for collaboration on projects through their site and the use of open source code has flourished in recent years in part because of GitHub's popularity. Thanks for reading! -Matt
